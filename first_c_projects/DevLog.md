# 1000 Hours of Code: DevLog

---

## Day 1: First Code, First Commit, First GitHub Repo!

**Date:** 2024-05-22 (Replace with today's actual date)
**Time Spent:** ~4 hours time blocks.

**Topics Covered:**

* Setting up VS Code and GCC compiler.
* Writing and running my very first C program ("Hello, World!").
* Understanding the basic structure of a C program (`#include <stdio.h>`, `int main()`, `printf()`, `return 0;`).
* Compiling C code using GCC (`gcc source.c -o executable`).
* Running executable programs from the terminal (`./executable` or `.\executable`).
* **Crucially:** Understanding the "compile-run" cycle – needing to recompile after every code change.
* Setting up a GitHub account and creating my first public repository (`1000-Hours-of-Code`).
* Initializing a local Git repository (`git init`).
* Staging files for commit (`git add filename.c`).
* Creating a commit (`git commit -m "message"`).
* Configuring Git user identity (`git config --global user.email`, `git config --global user.name`).
* Connecting local Git to GitHub (`git remote add origin URL`).
* Pushing local commits to GitHub (`git push -u origin master:main`).
* **Debugging:** Overcoming "No such file or directory" (file path issue) and "Author identity unknown" (Git config issue), and `src refspec main does not match any` (branch name issue).

**Summary:**

Today was a monumental first step!
They say the first step it's the harder one and boy, tell me about it. I feel like I sucessfully crossed the huge milestone of promissing myself I'll be a developer (for years) and actually writing my way in and out haha!

 I successfully navigated the initial setup of my C development environment, wrote my first C program, and learned the fundamental compile-run cycle. The biggest win was setting up my GitHub repository and pushing my first code there, overcoming several common Git/terminal hurdles. This truly feels like the start of my journey to become a developer, turning my writing passion into code. The immediate feedback from the compiler and terminal is incredibly motivating.

**Challenges:**

* It took me more hours then i'm willing to admit only on setting VS and the GCC compiler on its own. It was traumatizing but I learned so much on how to navegate files in windows cdm and command lines that i felt lowkey hacking. It was great for resilience, problem solving and fixing errors. When it finally worked it was the best feeling ever!
* Initially struggled with file paths and ensuring `gcc` found `hello.c`.
* Git configuration for user identity was a new step.
* Understanding the `master` vs. `main` branch difference during the first push.
* Remembering to recompile after every code change!

**What I Learned:**

* I did all with my own hands - no courses, tutorials or endless videos. Just reading, assembling and consulting my dear Sherlock (Gemini) friend to understand errors and next steps. The greatest deduction teacher since Sir Árthur Conan Doyle, no cap!
* Patience and persistence are key in debugging.
* Attention to details and to understand the bigger picture - context of what i'm doing.
* Error messages are incredibly valuable guides.
* The importance of precise commands for computers.
* The power of Git for version control and portfolio building.
* Github it's aesthetic and it's not hard as it looks, can't wait to fill up those 1000 hours on repositories.

**Next Steps:**

* Start working on the basic calculator program (Day 1, Hour 5).
* Continue practicing the compile-run cycle and Git commands.
